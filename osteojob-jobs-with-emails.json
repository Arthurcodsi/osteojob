In 2011 I opened The Plane Tree (theplanetree.co.uk), a clinic focusing on mind and body health with my psychologist wife. As well as being the base for Osteopathy London, the clinic offers massage, acupuncture, and a variety of talking therapies.\r\n\r\nI am a broad scope practitioner with interest and experience in cranial work and paediatrics alongside my manual osteopathic manual work. I have invested in extending my knowledge in exercise rehabilitation in the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe associate position will suit an osteopath comfortable working independently, though looking for a supportive professional relationship with a principal that will aim to develop their skills and breadth of practice, and assist them to explore their special interests.\r\n\r\nThe role:\r\n• The days required are Monday morning to lunchtime (9-2pm approx.), Friday daytime (time flexible) and Saturdays (10-5pm). Although there may be some flexibility for the right candidate in which weekdays and times are worked, Saturdays are required.\r\n• The associate will retain 62% of new patient fees and 57.5% of existing patient fees.\r\n• There is a £140 minimum per session retainer regardless of patient numbers on the day.\r\n• You will receive an annual financial contribution of £500 towards CPD costs made available at the end of each 12-month cycle of engagement.\r\n• You will retain 100% of fees for two weeks each year, by way of a holiday contribution from the principle.\r\n• Although I will not necessarily be present at the clinic to share challenging patients with you, I will be available to support you whenever possible.\r\n• We can organise regular meetings to discuss patients, your continued professional development, and to share techniques and ideas.\r\n\r\nRequirements for the associate are:\r\n• New graduates are welcome to apply.\r\n• Strong osteopathic manipulative skills.\r\n• To help patients “to appreciate both the physical dimensions and the relationship between body and mind in pain and dysfunction” as stated on our website.\r\n• Although training in the cranial approach is not essential, at least an interest in this and other subtle approaches is ideal.\r\n• A good basic understanding of exercise rehabilitation with a view to offering tailored advice to each patient would help, however before you start, I will aim to run you through some simple concepts to ensure you feel comfortable with assessing and advising patients from the very start.\r\n\r\nStructure of the practice:\r\n• We offer consultations of an hour to allow time enough for a comprehensive level of care as a prelude to future visits.\r\n• Follow-on treatments are a standard 40mins as this enables treatment, advice and exercises to be provided in a calm and relaxed manner.\r\n• We are a reception-less practice using Cliniko as our booking system. Naturally this will involve you taking payment from patients and arranging bookings in the few instances where online booking isn’t possible.\r\n\r\nThe role will suit a practitioner that enjoys the pace a 40min appointment allows, together with the opportunities it affords for an in-depth understanding of a patient’s issues through conversation, physical examination, and engagement. Where appropriate there will be time enough within sessions to develop and evolve an exercise programme, offer the cranial approach if trained to do so, and discuss relevant lifestyle concerns.\r\n\r\nStart date : November 2023 with some flexibility.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nPlease forward your CV with an accompanying introduction to johnosteopathylondon@gmail.com, or your contact details if you’d prefer to chat by phone to learn more.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohn",

        "content": "I am posting this ad on behalf of the lovely independent multidisciplinary clinic I have been renting a room with in Peckham for the last 5 years. I am moving away due to changes in life, but I have had a an interesting and busy practice here for nearly 5 years.\r\n\r\nOnly 5 minutes walk from Peckham Rye station, it's in a great area, lots of professionals and families. I have seen a mix of patients over the years, including some elderly, and a  good proportion of babies too.\r\n\r\nThe women who run the clinic are friendly and supportive, but fairly hands off, so you can build your practice as you like. I have worked structurally and cranially, as did the practitioner before me, but there is no specific requirement for this.\r\n\r\nThe rent has historically been low, so it's fairly easy to make decent money even from just one day's work per week.\r\n\r\nTake a look at bellendentherapies.co.uk to find out more about the clinic. You can either contact them direct, or contact me and I will put you in touch with the owners.",
