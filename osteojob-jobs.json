This is less than an hour from London by train.\r\nInitially, I'm offering 2 days per week, but this expected to grow over time. I have good relationships with local osteopathic practices slightly further afield in Chippenham and Bradford on Avon - between us we may be able to give someone full time hours if youre happy to work at multiple locations.\r\nMy clinic is predominately MSK, patients are accustomed to STW\/GOT\/HVT style of treatment, but we also do cranial and visceral work where required.

        "content": "I am looking for someone to step into my shoes! Initially this role could begin with locum support for my practice in July August time 2025, while I will be out of action following surgeries. I can support you during this time and if you were a new graduate then I can mentor you. This work could then nicely introduce you to my patients and you could stay in the practice part time until about July 2026. That's my exit date. I'm off to New Zealand!\r\nI don't have a clinic location to sell you but I work in two locations and both will be available for you to take on. The sale of goodwill will be a full and robust endorsement from me via email to my clients who are all avid readers of my posts on mailchimp.

In 2011 I opened The Plane Tree (theplanetree.co.uk), a clinic focusing on mind and body health with my psychologist wife. As well as being the base for Osteopathy London, the clinic offers massage, acupuncture, and a variety of talking therapies.\r\n\r\nI am a broad scope practitioner with interest and experience in cranial work and paediatrics alongside my manual osteopathic manual work. I have invested in extending my knowledge in exercise rehabilitation in the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe associate position will suit an osteopath comfortable working independently, though looking for a supportive professional relationship with a principal that will aim to develop their skills and breadth of practice, and assist them to explore their special interests.\r\n\r\nThe role:\r\n\u2022 The days required are Monday morning to lunchtime (9-2pm approx.), Friday daytime (time flexible) and Saturdays (10-5pm). Although there may be some flexibility for the right candidate in which weekdays and times are worked, Saturdays are required.\r\n\u2022 The associate will retain 62% of new patient fees and 57.5% of existing patient fees.\r\n\u2022 There is a \u00a3140 minimum per session retainer regardless of patient numbers on the day.\r\n\u2022 You will receive an annual financial contribution of \u00a3500 towards CPD costs made available at the end of each 12-month cycle of engagement.\r\n\u2022 You will retain 100% of fees for two weeks each year, by way of a holiday contribution from the principle.\r\n\u2022 Although I will not necessarily be present at the clinic to share challenging patients with you, I will be available to support you whenever possible.\r\n\u2022 We can organise regular meetings to discuss patients, your continued professional development, and to share techniques and ideas.\r\n\r\nRequirements for the associate are:\r\n\u2022 New graduates are welcome to apply.\r\n\u2022 Strong osteopathic manipulative skills.\r\n\u2022 To help patients \u201cto appreciate both the physical dimensions and the relationship between body and mind in pain and dysfunction\u201d as stated on our website.\r\n\u2022 Although training in the cranial approach is not essential, at least an interest in this and other subtle approaches is ideal.\r\n\u2022 A good basic understanding of exercise rehabilitation with a view to offering tailored advice to each patient would help, however before you start, I will aim to run you through some simple concepts to ensure you feel comfortable with assessing and advising patients from the very start.\r\n\r\nStructure of the practice:\r\n\u2022 We offer consultations of an hour to allow time enough for a comprehensive level of care as a prelude to future visits.\r\n\u2022 Follow-on treatments are a standard 40mins as this enables treatment, advice and exercises to be provided in a calm and relaxed manner.\r\n\u2022 We are a reception-less practice using Cliniko as our booking system. Naturally this will involve you taking payment from patients and arranging bookings in the few instances where online booking isn\u2019t possible.\r\n\r\nThe role will suit a practitioner that enjoys the pace a 40min appointment allows, together with the opportunities it affords for an in-depth understanding of a patient\u2019s issues through conversation, physical examination, and engagement. Where appropriate there will be time enough within sessions to develop and evolve an exercise programme, offer the cranial approach if trained to do so, and discuss relevant lifestyle concerns.\r\n\r\nStart date : November 2023 with some flexibility.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nPlease forward your CV with an accompanying introduction to johnosteopathylondon@gmail.com, or your contact details if you\u2019d prefer to chat by phone to learn more.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohn",

            "_job_description": "I am seeking a female self-employed osteopathic associate to join Osteopathy London (osteopathylondon.co.uk), an established clinic in Bethnal Green at the heart of London\u2019s East End.\r\n\r\nThe female only specific nature of this advert comes only after consulting our insurer, the IO, and the Equalities Act, before concluding that it is a Genuine Occupational Requirement proportionate to assist us to better serve our diverse local community.\r\n\r\nYou will be associate to myself, John Mallinder, and in joining together with my excellent associate Gervais this will bring to our community accessibility that is otherwise limited by our being two male practitioners.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been in practice since 1998 and taught for a number of years in the student Clinic of the British College of Osteopathic Medicine.\r\n\r\nAfter a period building my manual, cranial and paediatric skills as an associate, I established my own practice in Bethnal Green in 2001. In 2011 I opened The Plane Tree (theplanetree.co.uk), a clinic focusing on mind and body health with my psychologist wife. As well as being the base for Osteopathy London, the clinic offers massage, acupuncture, and a variety of talking therapies.\r\n\r\nI am a broad scope practitioner with interest and experience in cranial work and paediatrics alongside my manual osteopathic manual work. I have invested in extending my knowledge in exercise rehabilitation in the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe associate position will suit an osteopath comfortable working independently, though looking for a supportive professional relationship with a principal that will aim to develop their skills and breadth of practice, and assist them to explore their special interests.\r\n\r\nThe role:\r\n\u2022 The days required are Monday morning to lunchtime (9-2pm approx.), Friday daytime (time flexible) and Saturdays (10-5pm). Although there may be some flexibility for the right candidate in which weekdays and times are worked, Saturdays are required.\r\n\u2022 The associate will retain 62% of new patient fees and 57.5% of existing patient fees.\r\n\u2022 There is a \u00a3140 minimum per session retainer regardless of patient numbers on the day.\r\n\u2022 You will receive an annual financial contribution of \u00a3500 towards CPD costs made available at the end of each 12-month cycle of engagement.\r\n\u2022 You will retain 100% of fees for two weeks each year, by way of a holiday contribution from the principle.\r\n\u2022 Although I will not necessarily be present at the clinic to share challenging patients with you, I will be available to support you whenever possible.\r\n\u2022 We can organise regular meetings to discuss patients, your continued professional development, and to share techniques and ideas.\r\n\r\nRequirements for the associate are:\r\n\u2022 New graduates are welcome to apply.\r\n\u2022 Strong osteopathic manipulative skills.\r\n\u2022 To help patients \u201cto appreciate both the physical dimensions and the relationship between body and mind in pain and dysfunction\u201d as stated on our website.\r\n\u2022 Although training in the cranial approach is not essential, at least an interest in this and other subtle approaches is ideal.\r\n\u2022 A good basic understanding of exercise rehabilitation with a view to offering tailored advice to each patient would help, however before you start, I will aim to run you through some simple concepts to ensure you feel comfortable with assessing and advising patients from the very start.\r\n\r\nStructure of the practice:\r\n\u2022 We offer consultations of an hour to allow time enough for a comprehensive level of care as a prelude to future visits.\r\n\u2022 Follow-on treatments are a standard 40mins as this enables treatment, advice and exercises to be provided in a calm and relaxed manner.\r\n\u2022 We are a reception-less practice using Cliniko as our booking system. Naturally this will involve you taking payment from patients and arranging bookings in the few instances where online booking isn\u2019t possible.\r\n\r\nThe role will suit a practitioner that enjoys the pace a 40min appointment allows, together with the opportunities it affords for an in-depth understanding of a patient\u2019s issues through conversation, physical examination, and engagement. Where appropriate there will be time enough within sessions to develop and evolve an exercise programme, offer the cranial approach if trained to do so, and discuss relevant lifestyle concerns.\r\n\r\nStart date : November 2023 with some flexibility.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nPlease forward your CV with an accompanying introduction to johnosteopathylondon@gmail.com, or your contact details if you\u2019d prefer to chat by phone to learn more.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohn",
